A work-in-progress CQRS/Rest frameworky thing.

The goal is to provide an easy way to get started writing clojure apps that will
be immediately scalable in the throughput dimension as well as the code/behavior
dimension. Authentication is the first thing generally done when building a web
app so authentication is included. The components of this framework are designed
to be stand-alone libraries that are also designed to fit together. There could
be a library that composes the component libraries. For now, they assist with
the plumbing of building an app. You design your data with specs and provide
handler functions. These libraries will connect those functions.

These are the components::

- [bones.http](https://github.com/teaforthecat/bones-http)
- [bones.client](https://github.com/teaforthecat/bones-client)
- [bones.editable](https://github.com/teaforthecat/bones-editable)
- [bones.conf](https://github.com/teaforthecat/bones-conf)

Examples:

- [todomvc](https://github.com/teaforthecat/bones-todomvc)
- [app using kafka as db](https://github.com/teaforthecat/weather-report)

The design goal is to basically combine these libraries and add a data api:

- [re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame).
- [yada](https://github.com/juxt/yada).
- [Onyx](https://github.com/onyx-platform/onyx).


Influenced by:

- [From REST to CQRS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDNPQo9UmJA)
- [Designing with Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kP8wImz-x4w)
- [Everything Will Flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bNOO3xxMc0)

Aspiring to be:

- [Hoplon](http://hoplon.io/)
- [Untangled](http://untangled-web.github.io/untangled/)


Yet to be built:

There does exist a tiny library called `bones.jobs` but I'd like to expand that
to support the combination of Onyx and the `bones.http` library. (see diagram below)

- [bones.stream](#) (Onyx Wrapper)

The plan is for this frameworky thing to embrace systems by offering support
for Kafka and Redis; two integral parts of of this web app architecture. It
would make sense to help with the provisioning of these systems, so maybe
another library could come about doing that.
